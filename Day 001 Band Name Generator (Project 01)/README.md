# Day 001 : Band Name Generator 🎸

This was my first mini project while starting the **100 Days of Code – Python** journey.

---

## 🧠 What I Learned :
- Taking user input using `input()`,
- Working with variables,
- Printing output using `print()`,
- Basic string handling.

---

## 🎯 Project Idea :
The program asks the user for:
- The city they grew up in.
- Their pet name.

Then it combines them to generate a fun **band name**.

---

## 🚀 Outcome :
This project helped me understand how simple inputs and outputs work together and boosted my confidence as a beginner.
