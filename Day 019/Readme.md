# 🐢 Turtle Racing Game : Day 19 Project👇

## 📌 Project Overview :

This is a simple Turtle Racing Game built using Python's built-in turtle module.  
The game simulates a race between multiple turtles with different colors.  
Each turtle moves forward randomly, and the winner is determined based on speed.

This project was completed as part of my Day 19 Python learning journey.
