# 🎨 Hirst Painting Project (Day 18 - 100 Days of Code)👇

This project is inspired by Damien Hirst's dot paintings.  
Using Python and the Turtle module, I created a grid-based colorful dot painting automatically.

## 🚀 What I Learned :

- How to use the `turtle` module
- Working with RGB colors
- Extracting colors from an image (using colorgram)
- Loops
- Creating grid patterns using coordinates
- Controlling turtle movement and speed

## 🖌️ How It Works :

- Extracted a list of RGB colors from an image.
- The turtle draws multiple rows of colored dots.
- Each dot is randomly selected from the extracted color list.
- The turtle moves in a grid format to create a Hirst-style painting.

## 🛠️ Tech Used :

- Python
- Turtle Graphics
- colorgram (for color extraction)

## 📷 Output :

The program generates a colorful dot painting similar to Damien Hirst’s artwork.
