# ☕ Day 15 : Coffee Machine Project 👇

This project is part of the **100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp** by Dr. Angela Yu.

---

## 📌 Project Description :

A virtual coffee machine simulation built using Python.  
The program mimics the real-life working of a coffee machine where users can:

- Choose a coffee (espresso / latte / cappuccino),
- Check available resources,
- Insert coins to make payments,
- Receive coffee only if resources and payment are sufficient.

The machine keeps running until it is manually turned off.

---

## ⚙️ Features Implemented :

- Menu-driven coffee selection.
- Resource availability checking before making coffee.
- Coin-based payment system.
- Change calculation and refund handling.
- Resource deduction after each successful order.
- Earnings tracking.
- Report feature to view machine status.
- Safe user input handling for coin insertion.

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used :

- Functions and modular programming,
- Dictionaries (nested dictionaries),
- While loops,
- Conditional statements,
- Global variables,
- User input handling,
- Basic error handling using `try / except`,
- Real-world logic simulation.

---

## 🔁 Program Flow :

1. Program starts and displays the coffee machine logo,
2. User is prompted to choose a coffee or command (`report` / `off`),
3. Machine checks if sufficient resources are available,
4. User is asked to insert coins,
5. Transaction is verified against coffee cost,
6. Change is returned if applicable,
7. Resources and earnings are updated,
8. Coffee is served and machine continues running until turned off manually.

## 🚀 What I Learned :

- How to break a large problem into smaller reusable TODO's and hence functions,
- How to manage and update shared data using dictionaries,
- Importance of checking conditions before processing logic,
- How to simulate real-world systems using code,
- Why user input should not be blindly trusted,
- How basic error handling prevents program crashes,
- Writing cleaner, more readable, and structured code.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used :

- Python 3
