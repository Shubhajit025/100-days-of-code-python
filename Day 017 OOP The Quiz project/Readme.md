# Day 17 : Python OOP Basics & Quiz Project 🎯👇

Today I focused on learning the fundamentals of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python and applied those concepts by completing a **Quiz Project**.

## 📚 What I Learned Today :

### 🧱 Class Creation :
- How to create a class in Python.
- Understanding the structure of a class.
- Using `self` to refer to the current object.

### 🏗️ Constructor (`__init__` method) :
- How to use the `__init__` method.
- Creating attributes inside the constructor.
- Setting **default values** for attributes.
- Difference between instance attributes and default attributes.

### ⚙️ Methods :
- How to create methods inside a class.
- Using methods to access and modify object data.
- Calling methods using object instances.

### 🔗 Objects & Attributes :
- Creating objects from a class.
- Accessing attributes using dot (`.`) notation.
- Updating attribute values dynamically.

## 🧠 Project Completed: Quiz Game :

### 📌 Project Description :
- Built a quiz game using OOP concepts.
- Questions are stored as objects.
- Each question has:
  - Question text.
  - Correct answer.
- Used a quiz controller class to:
  - Ask questions.
  - Check answers.
  - Keep track of score.
  - Move to the next question.

### 🛠️ Concepts Used in the Project :
- Classes and objects.
- Constructor (`__init__`).
- Attributes and methods.
- Object interaction.
- Basic logic and flow control.

## 🚀 Outcome
This project helped me clearly understand how OOP works in real-world scenarios and how classes and objects make code more organized, reusable, and readable.
