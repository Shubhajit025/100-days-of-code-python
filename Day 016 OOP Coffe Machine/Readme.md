# Day 16 : Object Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python ☕👇

## 📌 Topics Covered :
On Day 16 of the **100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp**, I focused on learning and applying **Object Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Python.

---

## 🧠 What I Learned :
- What Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is,
- How to work with:
  - `Classes`
  - `Objects`
  - `Attributes`
  - `Methods`
- Difference between procedural programming and OOP.
- How to organize code using multiple files and classes.

---

## 🐢 Turtle Graphics (OOP in Practice) :
- Learned to use the built-in `turtle` library.
- Understood that:
  - `Turtle` is a class.
  - Each turtle created is an object Ex; `turtle = Turtle()`.
- Used object attributes and methods such as:
  - `.shape()`
  - `.color()`
  - `.forward()`
  - `.right()`

This helped me clearly understand how OOP works in real Python libraries.

## ☕ Coffee Machine Project (OOP Version) :
Rebuilt the Coffee Machine project using **Object-Oriented Programming** principles.

### 🔧 Project Details
- Used multiple Python files.
- Created classes for:
  - Coffee machine operations.
  - Menu and drinks.
  - Money handling.
- Imported all classes into `main.py`.
- Controlled the full program using objects, attributes, and methods.

### ✅ Concepts Applied :
- Object instantiation.
- Method calls.
- Attribute usage.
- Clean and maintainable code structure.

---

## 🚀 Outcome :
By completing Day 16, I am now comfortable with:
- Writing OOP-based Python programs.
- Understanding how real-world Python libraries are structured.
- Building scalable and organized projects using classes and objects.

---

📍 Next step: Continue improving OOP skills and apply them to larger projects.
